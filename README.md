# üí´ About Me:
Hey there! üëã I'm Rajan Sharma, a passionate MERN Stack Developer with a focus on crafting seamless user experiences through JavaScript. At 22 years old, I've immersed myself in the world of web development, specializing in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

üöÄ With proficiency in JavaScript libraries like React.js for frontend development and Express.js and Node.js for backend development, I've been building dynamic web applications that deliver both functionality and aesthetics.

üî≠ Currently, I'm juggling two exciting projects: an admin panel aimed at streamlining user management for a website and an Expense Tracking Website to help users manage their finances effectively.

üíº I'm on the lookout for opportunities to further hone my skills as a Web Developer. I thrive in environments where I can push boundaries and collaborate with talented individuals to bring innovative ideas to life.

üå± One of my passions lies in creating React applications by integrating CSS libraries like Tailwind CSS, which allows me to blend functionality with beautiful design seamlessly.

üíª I'm versatile in working on both the frontend and backend aspects of web development, enabling me to tackle projects from conception to deployment.

üì´ Ready to elevate your web development projects? Feel free to reach out to me via email: rajan4.sharma2001@gmail.com, and let's create something awesome together!
